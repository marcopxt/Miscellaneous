# Miscellaneous

Several scripts that I have builted and now making them avalaible

### Hope it helps anybody :)

1. Script to estimate the relationship matrix using SNP data: Additive from VanRaden (2008) and dominance matrix from Vitezica (2013) and Su et al. (2012).
2. Inbreeding measure from the SNP dataset
3. Quadpop example. Try to incorporate later
4. Dominated Pareto implementation. It works just fine for a few thousand data points.
