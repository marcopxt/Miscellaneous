# Miscellaneous

Several scripts that I have built and am now making available.

### Hope it helps anybody :)

1. Script to estimate the relationship matrix using SNP data: Additive from VanRaden (2008) and dominance matrix from Vitezica (2013) and Su et al. (2012).  

2. Inbreeding measure from the SNP dataset.  
3. Quadpop example. I'll try to incorporate it later.  
4. Dominated Pareto implementation. It works just fine for a few thousand data points.  
5. Simulation via AlphaSimR of a breeding program using BGLR and multi-traits.  
6. Function to get Bayesian stats for FAST tools as described in Smith and Cullis (2018). The input should be a factor analytic model from BGLR package.
